# Hyper Leverage — HIP-3 Perpetual Exchange (Closed Beta)

Version: v0.9b  
Network: Hyperliquid HIP-3 Testnet  
Builder: Hyperflow Labs  
Stake Requirement: 500 000 HYPE (locked)  

---

Hyper Leverage is a builder-deployed perpetual exchange built on HIP-3.  
The goal is to make permissionless perps trade like native Hyperliquid — fast, fair, and transparent.

This closed beta is limited access. Everything is experimental: we're validating  
order routing, funding accuracy, and risk behavior before mainnet release.

Trade small, find the edge cases, and report what breaks.
